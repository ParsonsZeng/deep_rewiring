# Introduction to Deep Rewiring in tensorflow
This repository is meant to share two basic scripts to illustrate Deep Rewiring. The scripts are showing how to solve Mnist with network that are kept very sparse all along the training. Two algorithm are implemented: Deep R and soft-Deep R. More math and simulations are described in our paper. Feel free to cite it if you use this code.
