# Introduction to Deep Rewiring in tensorflow
This repository is meant to share two basic scripts that illustrate Deep Rewiring. The scripts are showing how to solve Mnist with networks that are kept very sparse all along the training (only 2% of the connections are active). Two algorithm are implemented: Deep R and soft-Deep R. More math and simulations are described in our paper. Feel free to cite it if you use this code.
